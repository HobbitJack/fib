.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fib
is a Fibonacci number calculator.
Using binary expoentiation, it computes the \fITARGET\fRth Fibonacci number in O(log(N)), or when using the \fB\-p\fR flag it wil use the naive O(N) computation.
With the \fB\-m\fR flag it computes the largest Fibonacci number less than \fITARGET\fR, also using the O(N) computation.
\fITARGET\fR[s] are read from the command line, unless none are provided, in which case they are read from standard input.
This program defines the sequence such that F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, and so on.
.br
Output is given as 'TARGET: F(TARGET)\n'.
.SH OPTIONS
Mandatory options to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-base\fR=\fI\,BASE\/\fR
Output numbers in base \fIBASE\fR.
.I BASE
may be any base supported by GNU MP.
.br
\- Bases [2, 36] use integers, then lower-case letters.
.br
\- Bases [-2, -36] use integers, then upper-case letters.
.br
\- Bases [37, 62] use integers, upper-case letters, then lower-case letters.
.br
Invalid bases will cause a fatal error.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-loose\-exit\fR
Change the behavior of the exit status.
Normally, the program will exit non-zero if any invalid input is provided.
This flag will change the behavior such that the program will only exit non-zero if a fatal error is encountered.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-max\-value\fR
Print largest Fibbonaci number less than \fITARGET\fR.
This always uses the slower, naive O(N) algorithm.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\-all\fR
Print the whole Fibonacci sequence up to \fITARGET\fR.
This always uses the slower, naive O(N) algorithm.
This disables printing TARGET, even when \fB\-\-quiet\fR is not passed.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Disable the printing of \fITARGET\fR with the computed number.
This is probably more useful for scripts, but really probably is never going to be used.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Supress all error messages.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a short help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
